### SharingServices ###

===========================================================================
DESCRIPTION:

This example shows how to use the sharing services API (NSSharingService) in several ways:

* It invokes standard Twitter and Email sharing services directly from respective buttons.
* It creates a custom sharing service that can be selected from a sharing service picker (NSSharingServicePicker).


The main class is AppDelegate. This is the application delegate that configures the sharing buttons and acts as a controller to manage the sharing services.
